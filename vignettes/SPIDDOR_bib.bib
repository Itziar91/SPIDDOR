  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Qualitative frameworks, especially those based on
                 the logical discrete formalism, are increasingly used to model
                 regulatory and signalling networks. A major advantage of these
                 frameworks is that they do not require precise quantitative
                 data, and that they are well-suited for studies of large
                 networks. While numerous groups have developed specific
                 computational tools that provide original methods to analyse
                 qualitative models, a standard format to exchange qualitative
                 models has been missing. RESULTS: We present the Systems
                 Biology Markup Language (SBML) Qualitative Models Package
                 (``qual''), an extension of the SBML Level 3 standard designed
                 for computer representation of qualitative models of
                 biological networks. We demonstrate the interoperability of
                 models via SBML qual through the analysis of a specific
                 signalling network by three independent software tools.
                 Furthermore, the collective effort to define the SBML qual
                 format paved the way for the development of LogicalModel, an
                 open-source model library, which will facilitate the adoption
                 of the format as well as the collaborative development of
                 algorithms to analyse qualitative models. CONCLUSIONS: SBML
                 qual allows the exchange of qualitative models among a number
                 of complementary software tools. SBML qual has the potential
                 to promote collaborative work on the development of novel
                 computational approaches, as well as on the specification and
                 the analysis of comprehensive qualitative models of regulatory
                 and signalling networks.",

                 regulatory networks, a proper integration of molecular data
                 into a full-fledge formal dynamical model is ultimately
                 required. As most available data on regulatory interactions
                 are qualitative, logical modelling offers an interesting
                 framework to delineate the main dynamical properties of the
                 underlying networks. RESULTS: Transposing a generic model of
                 the core network controlling the mammalian cell cycle into the
                 logical framework, we compare different strategies to explore
                 its dynamical properties. In particular, we assess the
                 respective advantages and limits of synchronous versus
                 asynchronous updating assumptions to delineate the
                 asymptotical behaviour of regulatory networks. Furthermore, we
                 propose several intermediate strategies to optimize the
                 computation of asymptotical properties depending on available
                 knowledge. AVAILABILITY: The mammalian cell cycle model is

  abstract    = "Two types of distinct cardiac progenitor cell populations can
                 be identified during early heart development: the first heart
                 field (FHF) and second heart field (SHF) lineage that later
                 form the mature heart. They can be characterized by
                 differential expression of transcription and signaling
                 factors. These regulatory factors influence each other forming
                 a gene regulatory network. Here, we present a core gene
                 regulatory network for early cardiac development based on
                 published temporal and spatial expression data of genes and
                 their interactions. This gene regulatory network was
                 implemented in a Boolean computational model. Simulations
                 reveal stable states within the network model, which
                 correspond to the regulatory states of the FHF and the SHF
                 lineages. Furthermore, we are able to reproduce the expected
                 temporal expression patterns of early cardiac factors
                 mimicking developmental progression. Additionally, simulations
                 of knock-down experiments within our model resemble published
                 phenotypes of mutant mice. Consequently, this gene regulatory
                 network retraces the early steps and requirements of
                 cardiogenic mesoderm determination in a way appropriate to
                 enhance the understanding of heart development.",

                 involved in the control of crucial cellular processes calls
                 for proper modelling approaches. Indeed, models can help
                 elucidate properties of these networks, understand their

                 cells moves from individual pathways to complex regulatory
                 networks, mathematical models and simulation become
                 indispensable tools for analyzing the complex behavior of such
                 networks and can provide deep insights into the functioning of
                 cells. The dynamics of gene expression, for example, can be
                 modeled with Boolean networks (BNs). These are mathematical
                 models of low complexity, but have the advantage of being able
                 to capture essential properties of gene-regulatory networks.
                 However, current implementations of BNs only focus on
                 different sub-aspects of this model and do not allow for a
                 seamless integration into existing preprocessing pipelines.
                 RESULTS: BoolNet efficiently integrates methods for
                 synchronous, asynchronous and probabilistic BNs. This includes
                 reconstructing networks from time series, generating random
                 networks, robustness analysis via perturbation, Markov chain
                 simulations, and identification and visualization of

                 mathematical and graph-theoretical concepts. GINsim
                 encompasses an intuitive graph editor, enabling the definition

                 simulation engine to compute the corresponding qualitative
                 dynamical behaviour. Our computational approach is illustrated
                 by a preliminary model analysis of the inter-cellular
                 regulatory network activating Notch at the dorsal-ventral
                 boundary in the wing imaginal disc of Drosophila. We focus on

  abstract    = "While the use of computer tools to simulate complex processes
                 such as computer circuits is normal practice in fields like
                 engineering, the majority of life sciences/biological sciences
                 courses continue to rely on the traditional textbook and
                 memorization approach. To address this issue, we explored the
                 use of the Cell Collective platform as a novel, interactive,
                 and evolving pedagogical tool to foster student engagement,
                 creativity, and higher-level thinking. Cell Collective is a
                 Web-based platform used to create and simulate dynamical
                 models of various biological processes. Students can create
                 models of cells, diseases, or pathways themselves or explore
                 existing models. This technology was implemented in both
                 undergraduate and graduate courses as a pilot study to
                 determine the feasibility of such software at the university
                 level. First, a new (In Silico Biology) class was developed to
                 enable students to learn biology by ``building and breaking
                 it'' via computer models and their simulations. This class and
                 technology also provide a non-intimidating way to incorporate
                 mathematical and computational concepts into a class with
                 students who have a limited mathematical background. Second,
                 we used the technology to mediate the use of simulations and
                 modeling modules as a learning tool for traditional biological
                 concepts, such as T cell differentiation or cell cycle
                 regulation, in existing biology courses. Results of this pilot
                 application suggest that there is promise in the use of
                 computational modeling and software tools such as Cell
                 Collective to provide new teaching methods in biology and
                 contribute to the implementation of the ``Vision and Change''
                 call to action in undergraduate biology education by providing
                 a hands-on approach to biology.",
